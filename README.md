# MLAgents ShootAndDodge-IA
Machine learning project within the Unity environment where we're actively using ML agents reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to develop an enemy NPC character. This character, designed to be an flying-trigger enemy NPC that we're meticulously training to enhance its decision-making skills and adaptability through continuous interactions with its virtual surroundings. Leveraging the cutting-edge capabilities of Unity's ML agents RL framework, we're crafting a complex and dynamic training regimen that facilitates the NPC's ability to learn from its experiences, evolving its strategies for optimal performance. 

Feel free to navigate through the repository's different branches to explore the various training phases that showcase the progression of our project.
