# MLAgents ShootAndDodge-IA
Machine learning project within the Unity environment where we're actively using ML agents reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to develop an enemy NPC character. This character, designed to be an flying-trigger enemy NPC that we're meticulously training to enhance its decision-making skills and adaptability through continuous interactions with its virtual surroundings. Leveraging the cutting-edge capabilities of Unity's ML agents RL framework, we're crafting a complex and dynamic training regimen that facilitates the NPC's ability to learn from its experiences, evolving its strategies for optimal performance. 

Feel free to navigate through the repository's different branches to explore the various training phases that showcase the progression of our project.

## Characteristics of the Enemy NPC
- **Flight Capability:** The enemy character possesses the ability to navigate through the virtual environment using a flying mechanism.
- **Projectile Attack:** Armed with offensive capabilities, the enemy NPC engages in combat by launching projectiles at its adversaries.
- **Vulnerability:** The enemy NPC is susceptible to defeat upon contact.
- **Comparable Speed:** Lower velocity, preventing it from overtaking the player unfairly.
- **Strategic Cooldown:** To maintain a fair and engaging gameplay experience, the enemy NPC displays tactical acumen by imposing a cooldown period following each projectile assault, requiring prudent timing for optimal effectiveness.

## Phase 1
Learning whether to shoot.

## Phase 2
Learning with movement.

## Phase 5
Learning with movement at the NPC and the Player with better stats.

_upcoming soon..._
